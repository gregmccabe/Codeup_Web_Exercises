		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

		<p>Iâ€™m Olaf and I like warm hugs.</p>

			Bees will buzz, Kids will blow <em>dandelion fuzz</em> and I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.<br>
				A <strong>drink in my hand</strong> My snow up aginst the burning sand probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer.</p>
				<p>My favorit quote is:</p>
				<blockquote>"I believe that if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade... And try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka, and have a party."<br>  <em>Ron 'Tator Salad' White...</em></blockquote>
